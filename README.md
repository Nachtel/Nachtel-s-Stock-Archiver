# Nachtel-s-Stock-Archiver
At the moment only archives stocks from the New York Stock Exchange, but I will add Nasdaq and others in the future. Not very complex; uses Selenium to access websites containing stock information and pickles a spreadsheet (using Pandas) of both all stocks, their symbol, their dividends, etc, and a day-by-day archive of their prices. I am working on adding a GUI using Tkinter to make it easier to manage.
